## About
SquadStatJS is a Discord bot that shows the SQUAD players statistics using the database that [SquadJS](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/SquadJS) is producing.

## Using SquadStatJS
You can use this to entertain the players in your community. It will simulate the players in your server to play better and longer.

### Prerequisites
 * MySQL sql_mode should NOT have the following mode: `ONLY-FULL-GROUP-BY`
 * Git
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Current) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 * [SquadJS](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/SquadJS)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/11TStudio/SquadStatJS`
2. Configure the `.env.example` file. And when done SAVE and delete the .example. (At the end the file should look like: `.env`)
3. Run `npm install` via the terminal.
4. Start your bot: `node bot.js&`. (I recommend you to use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io))
5. Star this repo if you liked!

### Configuring SquadStatJS
SquadStatJS can be configured via .env file which by default is called .env.example.

The config file needs to be called .env at the end and a example can be found below:

 * `battleMetricsToken` - It is not usefull for now. Don't touch it.
 * `channelRestricted` - You can choose between `true` and `false`. `false`: Players can use the commands everywehere in the servr. `true`: Will check the channelID (see `statChannel`) and respond only for that room. It will promt an error if you use it elsewhere.
 * `statChannel` - The room/channelID that players can use the bot (only works if `channelRestricted=true`).

 * `footerImg` - The little logo/image on the footer of each embed.

## Creating Your Own Command
To create your own command you need a basic knowledge of NodeJS and DiscordJS.

I made a `comms/command.js.example` ready to be edited. Just delete the `.example` from it and you will be ready to go.

## Statement on Accuracy
Some of the information SquadJS collects from Squad servers was never intended or designed to be collected. Therefor it could be that the information the bot is showing is not 100% correct, because SquadJS issues/errors/miscalculation.

## Contribute
TODO...

## Credits
SquadStatJS would not be possible without:
 * [SquadJS](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/SquadJS) the main reason this bot exist.
 * [Anatolia Squad Community](https://www.anatoliacommunity.com) For helping me test the bot.
